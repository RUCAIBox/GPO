{"input": "Which of the following statements best describes the process of 'medicalization'?\n(A) The term 'medicalization' refers to the process whereby a medical or health issue becomes securitized.\n(B) 'Medicalization' is the outcome of security dialogue that discusses threats or risks to national security in terms of medical language.\n(C) An issue is said to be 'medicalized' when it is dismissed as a security threat, instead deemed to be a medical issue concerning health as mutually exclusive from security.\n(D) The perceived 'medicalization' of societies occurs when social issues are increasingly considered and responded to as medical problems.", "output": "(D)"}
{"input": "Given current patterns of industrial development, what are the future prospects for energy security?\n(A) Whilst energy consumption is correlated to levels of industrialisation, developed states of the North continue to increase their demands for energy. This is balanced by a lesser demand from states in the South; due to their lack of industrialisation their demands on energy are forecast to remain low.\n(B) Energy demand in the industrialised states has peaked in recent years and data indicates that consumption levels in the North have become constant and are not likely to increase.\n(C) Whilst forecasts predict that energy consumption in the industrialised states of the North will continue to increase, the major increase in demand will come from the developing states of the South, posing major challenges to global energy security.\n(D) Although demand from developing states is set to increase the global consumption of dwindling energy resources, technological advancements in alternative energy sources, coupled with comprehensive understanding of current resource levels and access, will secure energy supply in the foreseeable future.", "output": "(C)"}
{"input": "Prior to the late 20th century the role of women in war had been neglected as an area of concern in security studies, for what reason?\n(A) Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security.\n(B) The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.\n(C) The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system.\n(D) Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.", "output": "(B)"}
{"input": "What is the relationship between historical materialism and the global justice movement?\n(A) Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n(B) Historical materialism has an established history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality; during the Cold War it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states.\n(C) Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.\n(D) Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.", "output": "(D)"}
{"input": "Which of the following are trends to emerge in the global defence trade since the end of the Cold War?\n(A) A growing effort by governments to prevent the spread of weapons, especially of WMDs.\n(B) A growth in volume of the arms trade.\n(C) A change in the nature of the defence trade, linked to the changing nature of conflict.\n(D) All of these options.", "output": "(D)"}
{"input": "In what ways may TNC be regarded as a new concept?\n(A) Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes.\n(B) Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.\n(C) Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.\n(D) The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime. The pursuit of profit for illicit activity eludes definition and may include those individuals or businesses that engage in occasional transnational criminal activity but are otherwise legitimate operatives.", "output": "(B)"}
{"input": "Which of these statements is commonly regarded as a tangible benefit of the securitization process?\n(A) Securitizing injects urgency into an issue and leads to a sustained mobilization of political support and deployment of resources.\n(B) Securitization encourages more efficient handling of complex problems.\n(C) Securitization mobilizes popular support for policies in specific areas by calling them security relevant and encourages the allocation of more resources.\n(D) All of these options.", "output": "(D)"}
{"input": "What differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic?\n(A) From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.\n(B) The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.\n(C) The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.\n(D) Theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.", "output": "(C)"}
{"input": "What problems has the post-Cold War security literature revealed on women, war, development, and security?\n(A) Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues.\n(B) The technological capacity to wage war with minimal civilian costs has abolished the threat of physical and biological gender victimization. The contemporary gender divide is structured on 'soft' issues associated with socio-economic hardship.\n(C) Conflict in warfare and the gender divide between men and women is centred on the historical contract between the individual and the state. The 'right to fight' debate has equal meaning and saliency across the globe, and is universally applicable in all situations.\n(D) Nuclear armaments and the threat of mass destruction have rendered the battlefield gender neutral in terms of its destructive capabilities. Whilst historically conventional warfare was conducted on the battlefield in which women were particularly vulnerable to violence, and post-conflict sexual violence, these threats no longer exist.", "output": "(A)"}
{"input": "In the context of energy security and the production of oil, which of the following does not define the term 'stability'?\n(A) The absence of challenges to the regime of oil-producing states.\n(B) A political and economic situation in which the status quo of production, exportation and supply is maintained.\n(C) The promotion of human security and the affiliated environmental security as a priority within oil-producing states.\n(D) The security of regimes deemed 'friendly' by North American, European, and international oil company interests.", "output": "(C)"}
{"input": "Describe the relationship between the military security domain and social constructivism.\n(A) It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.\n(B) Social constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based; in rejecting the empirical basis of security studies, the social constructivist approach becomes inadequate in its attempts to formulate military security theory.\n(C) Social constructivism is based on philosophical ideas that directly contradict the foundations of military-centred theory. The tendency is for social constructivists to dismiss military endeavours as clumsy and as being detrimental to human security.\n(D) In order to study military security, analysts must adopt a realist lens. However, this can later be combined with other approaches, including social constructivism, in order to consider the security of different referent objects such as the environment or human security.", "output": "(A)"}
{"input": "In what ways does the idea of 'victim' impact on the way in which gender security is regarded?\n(A) Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery).\n(B) The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized as the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription become more apparent. When imagining victims, there is no longer a gender divide. Instead, there is a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics.\n(C) Increasing awareness regarding the barbaric nature of warfare and the problems of trauma in war has led to a reversal in the belief that the idea of war is a natural place for males. In contemporary societies across the globe, men are regarded as the victims of gender stereotypes that coerce them into violent behaviour as 'protectors' or aggressors on behalf of the state.\n(D) All of these options.", "output": "(A)"}
{"input": "In the context of military security, which of the following is not an obvious benefit of adopting a 'critical' theoretical approach?\n(A) A more critical approach to military security studies will allow the inclusion or adoption of non-realist paradigms, such as social constructivism.\n(B) Critical analysis of military security will draw attention back to traditional conceptions of the state-centric paradigm which have been neglected in recent years, with states favouring human security and other non-traditional approaches instead.\n(C) By implementing a critical analysis we can recognise that traditional conceptions of military security are no longer always salient and may need to be reconsidered.\n(D) A critical approach would recognise the changing ontology of security in the real world. Such changes are evident in the new ways in which war has been conducted in the 20th and 21st century.", "output": "(B)"}
{"input": "In what ways might the effects of chemical weapons affect the decision to deploy them against a target?\n(A) Chemical weapons are a highly complicated means to conduct an assault. The unpredictability of chemicals (the degree of evaporation, stability and concentration) frequently proves to be incommensurate with political objectives.\n(B) Analysts are concerned with the potential ease of chemical manufacturing. Weapons could be quickly and effectively deployed being light, concealable and rapidly deployed. Most weapons can be delivered in a line source for example a crop duster or administered through an aerosol. Dispersal in areas of poor ventilation or closed venues where people are in close proximity could have potentially catastrophic effects.\n(C) Chemical weapons have the potential to cause mass casualties. Moderate exposure to chemicals produces serious side effects and would generate serious casualties if weaponized.\n(D) Wind, temperature and terrain can affect the lethality and persistence of an agent and is dependent on the extensity and degree of contact with the target.", "output": "(D)"}
{"input": "Which of the following characteristics describe 'Category B' agents, as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control?\n(A) Category B agents are those that present little to no risk or morbidity within infected populations, but can have detrimental effects on the ability of a group to perform physical tasks.\n(B) Unlike Category A agents, B agents refer to emerging security threats which have the potential to be utilised as biological weapons after further development.\n(C) Category B agents include food and water security threats, with moderate morbidity rates.\n(D) Category B agents are characterised by high mortality rates and include agents which are difficult to treat medically.", "output": "(C)"}

{"input": "What role does 'Information' play in the economic science of decision making?\n(A) Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process.\n(B) Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices.\n(C) Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\n(D) Information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be sold and traded as a market commodity.", "output": "(C)"}
{"input": "Which of the following ways is NOT a defining feature that distinguishes postcolonialism from other perspectives on security?\n(A) Postcolonialism uniquely considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies.\n(B) Postcolonialism takes account not only of major war, but also of so-called 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts.\n(C) Postcolonialism employs a distinctive focus on the role of violence in world politics.\n(D) Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge.", "output": "(A)"}

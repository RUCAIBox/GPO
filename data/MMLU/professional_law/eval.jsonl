{"input": "One day, an 11-year-old boy came home from school with red lipstick stains on his collar. When the boy's mother inquired about the lipstick stains, the boy said that his teacher had kissed him. The mother then contacted the police, who subsequently conducted an investigation and arrested the teacher, charging her with two felony counts of child molestation. In accord with state law, a preliminary hearing was scheduled. After the boy was subpoenaed to testify at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution filed a motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance. The motion, with supporting affidavits from a child psychologist, claimed that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. The judge should\n(A) deny the motion, because a pretrial proceeding is an early stage of trial, and a defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at every stage of the trial.\n(B) deny the motion, because the teacher's exclusion from the courtroom would have prejudicial impact on receiving effective assistance of counsel.\n(C) grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.\n(D) grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.", "output": "(D)"}

On this day, she negligently \"nodded off\" for just a few seconds on a park bench with the stroller next to her. She felt some movement and snapped awake to see a man taking the baby from the stroller. The man was large and menacing-looking. The babysitter, who is thin and petite, froze and did not put up a struggle as the man stated, \"I will kill you if you move.\" The babysitter did scream and call for help as the kidnapper fled with the child. Within a few yards he tripped and dropped the baby on its head. The baby died at the hospital of massive head injuries. Is it probable that the prosecutor will charge the babysitter with a crime, and if so, what will be the charge?\n(A) Yes, this is felony murder in that the babysitter's unacceptable behavior was committed during the commission of the kidnapping felony.\n(B) No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances  her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.\n(C) No, because she did not do anything wrong in dozing off and she had no duty to protect the baby at the expense of her own life.\n(D) Yes, she would be charged with negligent homicide because it was foreseeable that if she fell asleep for even just a few seconds, the baby would likely be kidnapped and killed.", "output": "(B)"}

The only information provided was a general notice from the city declaring a new policy on massage parlors that had to be rapidly instituted for the welfare of the community. She sued the city in federal court, claiming that her business had been taken without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment takings clause. She claimed a lack of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted a motion to dismiss based on her not having a property interest that was affected, including in the license and permits. She appealed the decision. Will the federal Court of Appeals affirm the lower court dismissal of her case?\n(A) Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.\n(B) Yes, because the state interest in protecting the public from illegal activities required the state action that was taken.\n(C) No, because once the parlor had opened with all the proper permits, it could not be deprived of its licenses for any reason until they were up for renewal.\n(D) No, because she had a property right in her license and permits, which were taken without any procedural due process.", "output": "(D)"}

{"input": "After graduating from law school, a graduate moved to a city where she had been offered a position in an entertainment law firm.

In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed.

Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered.

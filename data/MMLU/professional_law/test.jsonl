At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after the defeats in a recent election, the Party expelled all nonLatino members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees.

Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U.

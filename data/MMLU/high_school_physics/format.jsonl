{"input": "It is observed that sounds can be heard around a corner but that light cannot be seen around a corner. What is a reasonable explanation for this observation?\n(A) Light travels at 3 × 10^8 m/s, which is too fast to change direction around a corner.\n(B) Sound has a longer wavelength, which increases the diffraction.\n(C) Light is an electromagnetic wave that is behaving as a particle.\n(D) Sound is a mechanical wave that can change direction in its propagation media.", "output": "(B)"}
{"input": "You have a wire of length L, radius Q, and resistance Q. You need to obtain half that resistance using the same material and changing only one factor. You could\n(A) use half the length\n(B) use twice the length\n(C) use half the radius\n(D) use twice the radius", "output": "(A)"}
{"input": "A pair of protective headphones reduces the sound of a jet engine from 140 dB to 110 dB. What percent of the noise is being blocked?\n(A) 99.90%\n(B) 78.60%\n(C) 21.40%\n(D) 0.10%", "output": "(A)"}
{"input": "An object initially at rest experiences a time-varying acceleration given by a = (2 m/s^3)t for t ≥ 0. How far does the object travel in the first 3 seconds?\n(A) 9 m\n(B) 12 m\n(C) 18 m\n(D) 24 m", "output": "(A)"}
{"input": "A spherical conductor carries a net charge. How is this charge distributed on the sphere?\n(A) The charge is evenly distributed on the surface.\n(B) The charge resides on the surface only; the distribution of charge on the surface depends on what other charged objects are near the sphere.\n(C) The charge moves continually within the sphere.\n(D) The charge is distributed uniformly throughout the sphere.", "output": "(B)"}

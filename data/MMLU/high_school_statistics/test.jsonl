Which of these would be the best way to proceed?\n(A) Use the 88 who did respond, using 88 as the sample size in the analysis.\n(B) Use the 88 who did respond, using 120 as the sample size in the analysis.\n(C) Attempt to contact the 32 who did not respond and get the information from them.\n(D) Select 32 more graduates at random and use them to replace the nonresponders.", "output": "(C)"}

{"input": "The registrar’s office at a university has noticed that a large number of students fail to report a change of address. The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?\n(A) The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\n(B) Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\n(C) The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\n(D) The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.", "output": "(D)"}
{"input": "A farmer who raises hens for egg production wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56 grams. He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\n(A) Because tis more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n(B) Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n(C) Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n(D) Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.", "output": "(B)"}
